1. AI Filtering

An Actual AI Filter for filtering user interactions, a genuine, smart AI system that will almost never false report

here are some examples:

example 1:

> A user says something bad intending to target someone,
>
> Jade will read the conversation and filter that message and store the message in the selected reports channel as 'disrespectiveness'
> 
> if she detects the previous 15 messages were argumentive (aka they were going back and forth at eachother) she will mark the report as heated arguement

example 2:

> A user says something bad not fullty intending to target someone and used as an example or describing the word
>
> Jade will read the conversation and warn the user, and send it to reports as 'suggestive'
>
> if she detects that the user is describing someones word, she will mark the report as 'sarcastic mocking'

2. vocal filtering

something never seen on discord, jade will sit in a stage with you and if you bring someone onto the stage and they start saying stuff jade will mention it in the text channel in that stage

3. modmail

jade will be able to make a modmail system for you, this would be key for annonymous reporting, keeping track of individual user reports, or ban appealings

4. middleman modmail

jade will become the middleman for your modmail system, her ai will read the conversation and stop mod abuse (e.g. the user is asking why the user was banned and they're proving key points to why the mod was wrong or stupid rules (jade's middleman will not care if you have stupid rules, if its stupid enough she will side with the user no matter what, e.g. no simple questions, thats a stupid rule) and if the mod starts namecalling to that user who haven't been namecalling, jade will cut their access to the conversation and mod abilities and send the context to reports as 'mod abuse')
